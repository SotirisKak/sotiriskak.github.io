Pipeline to accelerate material parameter identification for soft tissues. As examples, we use our previous work on characterization of blood clot and right ventricular myocardium. We have made all datasets (synthetic and experimental) publicly available [here](https://github.com/SoftTissueBiomechanicsLab/ML-soft-material-parameters).
