In this project, we perform a numerical study on the mechanics of embedded fiber networks. Given the fibrous microstructure of the myocardium, our overall goal is to describe its mechanics in terms of embedded fiber networks. Therefore, as a first step, we aim to establish a computationally efficient modeling approach towards this end. In short, we implement a mortar type finite element method by Steinbrecher et al. (2020) in order to embed spatial beams (fibers) in a hyperelastic solid matrix, subject to large deformations.
