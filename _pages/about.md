I'm a PhD candidate at the Engineering Mechanics program, at the Univerisity of Texas at Austin. Since August 2018, I've been working with Dr. Manuel Rausch at the [Soft Tissue Biomechanics Lab](http://www.manuelrausch.com). My research interests include **cardiovascular mechanics, nonlinear solid mechanics, computational modeling and machine learning**.

Prior to joining UT Austin, I received a diploma in mechanical engineering from Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece. After my graduation in 2016, I worked as a Research Assistant at the [Machine Dynamics Lab,](https://www.meng.auth.gr/en/lab/1-1-machine-dynamics-laboratory-mdl/) under the supervision of prof. Sotirios Natsiavas, conducting modeling and simulations on **rigid and flexible multibody dynamics.**
