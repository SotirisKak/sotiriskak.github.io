I'm a PhD candidate at the Engineering Mechanics program, at the Univerisity of Texas at Austin. Since August 2018, I've been working with Dr. Manuel Rausch at the Soft Tissue Biomechanics Lab. My research interests include cardiovascular mechanics, nonlinear solid mechanics, computational modeling and machine learning.

Prior to joining UT Austin, I recieved a diploma in mechanical engineering from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece. After my graduation in 2016, I worked as a Research Assistant at the Machine Dynamics Lab, under the supervision of prof. Sotirios Natsiavas, working on rigid and flexible multibody dynamics, conducting modeling and simulations.
