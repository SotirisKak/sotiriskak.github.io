In this project, I implement the simplest version of a multi-layered actuator, with only one layer of dielectric elastomer (active region) covered by a stiffer thin layer (passive region).
The actuator is modeled in ABAQUS by implementing a UMAT subroutine. Also, included a (short) sensitivity analysis by examining the effect of stiffness and thickness variations of the thin layer to the overall mechanical response of the actuator. Finally, I examine and model the case of distributed stiffeners along the free surface of the elastomer.
