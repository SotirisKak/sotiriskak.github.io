Featured on [Ansys Developer's portal](https://developer.ansys.com/blog/biomedical-catheter-design-analysis), my Summer 2023 project as a Computational & Structural Mechanics intern at Ansys. I developed a Python pipeline, using PyMAPDL framework, to study the apparent mechanical properties of flexible, biomedical catheters.

Specifically, I modeled the catheters as reinforced elastomers with beam elements, under large deformation. I was particularly interested in the effective flexural rigidity of the catheter, as a function of the reinforcement type. More details can be found in the [article](https://developer.ansys.com/blog/biomedical-catheter-design-analysis).
